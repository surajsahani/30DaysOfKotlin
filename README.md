# SoundPlay
SoundPlay. Just as the name of this meditation app states, SoundPlay is a portal to peace of mind.
Feeling more anxious than usual lately? While we could probably all use a wellness retreat right about now, a trip isn't the only way to relax. The purported benefits of meditation include increased focus, reduced stress, and better sleep. To help you ease into a mindfulness practice weâ€™ve rounded up the best meditation apps, including Headspace, Calm, Aura, and more.
